This is the privacy policy of the research project "Socio-legal research and Social Networks: Connections Between Academia and the Legal Field in Argentina". The policy states the following:

# Objectives of research 

The research focuses on registering social networks within the Buenos Aires (Argentina) legal community, specially in order to describe the links between legal academia, the judiciary, and the legal profession. It takes as "subjects" legal professionals, judges, prosecutors, and law professors. 

# Methodology

The research projects is based on a Social Network Analysis (SNA) approach, based on the analysis of quantiative data. This data is formed by the connections between the different nodes of a social network to be constructed through research on publicly available sources (websites, official datasets, and so on). 

# Data to be gathered

In order to build the network to which the SNA methodology will be applied, the data to be gathered from publicly available sources is `surname`, `name` and `employer`. No other personal information (e.g., email, phones, personal Linkedin contacts, and so on) will be gathered. 

# Treatment of data 

The data gathered will be used to build a social network, formed by connections between different nodes, in which the nodes are people (`surname` + `name`) who are connected by the place where they work (`employee`). The identity of employers will be used for plotting purposes.
