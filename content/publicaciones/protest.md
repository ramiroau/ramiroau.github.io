Social protest is not new to Latin America; the continent is reputed for its high levels of mass mobilization and political activism. However, there is a novelty to the type of social protest that arose in the region over the last few decades, particularly in the late '90s. In that time, many (previously nonexistent) factors were combined to give way to very peculiar forms of social conflict.
