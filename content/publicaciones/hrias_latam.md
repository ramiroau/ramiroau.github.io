Human Rights Impact Assessments (HRIA) have become an important tool of corporate governance in the field of business and human rights, and—thus—have been embraced by companies in the ICT sector. This was to an extent predictable: for quite some time now, Internet companies have been accused of violating human rights through action or omission. In this context, HRIAs appear as a procedural mechanism that may help them make better decisions and, at least, curb criticism. This paper seeks to contribute to inquiries into this development by highlighting the regulatory context in which HRIAs emerged within the ICT sector, the institutional history of the tool, its ambiguous genealogy, and the challenges and opportunities for its usage in Latin America.
