In this short contribution, we will address the issue of the state of liberal democracy in the country by studying a selection of cases announced by the Supreme Court during 2017 and the politics surrounding them. Two reasons explain this focus. First, the last constitutional amendment in Argentina---to the 1853 Constitution, still in force---took place in 1994 and a new one is not expected soon. The Court has a very important role in constitutional argument or dialogue in the country. Second, the Court has recently undergone a change in personnel in the context of broader political change. This event provides an exceptional opportunity to explore possible jurisprudentials shifts in the making. Though it is still early to provide a conclusive judgment, the new members of the Court seem willing to revise the commitment to international human rights law (which is part of the domestic constitutional system) expressed in previous years.
