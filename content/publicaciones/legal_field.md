Social network analysis (SNA) is a methodology to study complex systems. It has been used for many purposes: from studying the structure of English trade in the East Indies between 1601 and 1833 to the temporal structure of consensus formation in science. While its history goes back to the early twentieth century, its expansion follows the availability of computers as a way of gathering, organizing and transforming the data necessary to construct a "social network." This paper uses this methodology to study the structure of the legal field in the city of Buenos Aires.
