Una dimensión importante de los casos constantes es que hay "impunidad", juega un rol la doctrina de qualified immunity, aparentemente [totalmente judicial](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Qualified_immunity).

> Qualified immunity is a legal doctrine in United States federal law that shields government officials from being sued for discretionary actions performed within their official capacity, unless their actions violated "clearly established" federal law or constitutional rights. Qualified immunity thus protects officials who "make reasonable but mistaken judgments about open legal questions", but does not protect **"the plainly incompetent or those who knowingly violate the law"**.  

Sería medio insólito que algo así pueda proteger algo como el caso Floyd. Y dicen que [no ayudaría](https://t.co/JTR1JjWloz).

> "The Supreme Court developed the legal doctrine through a series of decisions dating back to 1967 that were meant to protect government employees from frivolous litigation. But qualified immunity defenses have largely been used to prevent people from suing police officers who use excessive force. The concept is that people who sue police must show that the officer broke a “clearly established” law, which has turned into a difficult standard in many cases."
