# Ingredientes

320 g di pasta a tua scelta
40 g di burro
15 foglie di salvia

# Instrucciones

1. Cook the pasta in plenty of salted water. While it's cooking, prepare the sauce to season it.


2. Melt the butter in a large pan and as soon as it's melted add the sage leaves, letting them sizzle gently for a few seconds (they shouldn't burn, but release their scent).

3. When the pasta is cooked al dente, drain it and toss it in the pan for a minute together with a little cooking water. When a fluid sauce has been created, turn off the heat and serve very hot.

If you wish, you can add a handful of Parmigiano Reggiano and also a grind of black pepper.

Tip â†’ finish cooking the pasta, drained al dente, in the pan with the butter, adding a couple of tablespoons of the pasta cooking water. Stir often until a creamy sauce has formed, thanks to the starch contained in the water. At this point you can add Parmesan (or pecorino) to your taste, both grated and in flakes.
