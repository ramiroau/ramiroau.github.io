- 1/2 teaspoon salt
- 1/4 teaspoon pepper
- 1 lb boneless skinless chicken thighs, cut into 1-in cubes

## Fried Rice

- 2 tablespoons vegetable oil
- 1 small onion, finely diced
- 2 medium carrots, diced into 1/2-in cubes
- 3 cloves garlic, minced
- 3 large eggs, lightly beaten
- 3 cups cold cooked rice
- 1/2 cup frozen peas

# Instructions

## Cilantro Lime Chicken

In a medium bowl, whisk lime juice, olive oil, garlic, cilantro, salt, and pepper until smooth. Add chicken to bowl and toss until coated. Let chicken marinate in refrigerator at least 1 hour. 

## Fried Rice

1. Remove chicken from marinade and discard remaining marinade. In a large non-stick skillet, heat 1 tablespoon oil over medium-high heat until shimmery. Add chicken and saute several minutes until chicken is no longer pink. Remove chicken from pan and wipe pan clean.

2. Reduce heat to medium. Add eggs to skillet and gently fold edges up as the eggs cook to let the middle portion cook. Once egg as set, turn out of pan onto a cutting board. Chop into bite-sized pieces.

3. Heat remaining 1 tablespoon oil over medium-high heat. Saute onion and carrot until just tender. Add garlic and saute 1 minute until fragrant.

4. Add chicken, rice, peas, cooked egg, soy sauce, and lime juice to skillet and saute several minutes until heated through. Season rice with salt and pepper to taste and top with fresh cilantro. Serve hot and enjoy!
