# Ingredientes

- 1 quart sunflower oil, or as needed- 

- 6 medium green zucchini- 

- 4 ounces spaghetti- 

- 2 tablespoons olive oil- 

- 1 pinch salt- 

- 2 basil leaves, torn into small pieces- 

- 2 tablespoons unsalted butter- 

- 5 tablespoons grated Pecorino Romano cheese- 

- 3 tablespoons grated Parmigiano-Reggiano cheese

# Pasos

- Place sunflower oil in a deep fryer and heat to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Slice zucchini into 1/8-inch rounds.- 

- Add some zucchini to the hot oil and deep-fry until lightly browned, 4 to 5 minutes. Transfer to a single layer on paper towels to drain and repeat to cook remaining zucchini. Let zucchini cool to room temperature.- 

- Transfer cooled zucchini to a bowl. Cover and refrigerate, 8 hours to overnight.- 

- Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Cook spaghetti in the boiling water, stirring occasionally, until it's 2 minutes away from being tender yet firm to the bite, 9 to 10 minutes.- 

- As you are cooking the spaghetti, heat olive oil in a skillet over medium heat. Add zucchini and salt and cook, stirring occasionally, until it starts to release juices, soften, and break down, 3 to 5 minutes. Add a couple splashes of the pasta water to the zucchini, but don't overdo it. Break zucchini into small pieces with the edge of a spoon or spatula. Reduce heat to low and toss in basil and butter; stir until butter melts.- 

- Grab spaghetti with tongs and transfer it right into the sauce; stir until coated. Mix in Pecorino Romano and Parmigiano-Reggiano cheeses. Add a final splash of pasta water and adjust salt if needed.- 

- Serve with more grated cheese and fresh basil.
