# Ingredientes

Lentils: You want to use large brown whole lentils for this recipe. They give the mujadara the best texture, and the color is an iconic part of the recipe.

Rice: You can pretty much use any type of rice you want for mujadara, but I prefer to use white long-grain rice because it’s how it’s traditionally made and gives the best texture. If you’re using brown rice, you’ll need to extend the cooking time. You can also use bulgur or cracked wheat in place of rice.

Onions + oil: Sliced onions are pan-fried until crispy, then left to sit on paper towels while the mujadara cooks. They make a delicious topping and crisp up as they sit.

Seasonings: Cumin and salt to taste.


# Detalles

- ½ cup olive oil
- 2 large yellow onions thinly sliced
- 4 ½ cups water
- 2 cups brown lentils rinsed and drained
- Salt
- 1 cup long grain white rice rinsed
- 2 teaspoons cumin

# Proceso

## Topping

1. Heat olive onion over high heat. Add the onions and cook, stirring constantly, until the onions are deeply browned and start to crisp around the edges.

2. Transfer to a paper towel-lined plate to help draw out the extra oil, they will crisp up more as they sit.

## Proceso

1. While the onions are frying, heat another pot and add the lentils with salt.
2. Add water and bring to a boil before reducing the heat and covering it with a lid.
3. After rinsing the drained rice, transfer it to the pot.
4. Stir to combine the lentils and rice and return the lid to continue cooking.
5. Remove the pot from the heat and rest, covered, and sprinkle on the cumin (aprox. two table spoons).
6. Fluff the rice and lentils with a fork to combine.

# POPULAR SUBSTITUTIONS & ADDITIONS

1. **Cook extra onions into the mujadara**. When I originally published this recipe, I included two sets of onions, some mixed into the rice and lentils, and the crispy ones on top of the rice and lentils. This is how my mom prefers to make mujadara, and it adds a ton of flavor, but it does add time to the recipe, which is why I’ve updated it now to only include the onions on top.

2. **Make it with brown rice**. The difference between white rice and brown rice for mujadara is that brown rice will need to cook a little longer. Instead of adding the rice halfway through cooking the lentils, you’ll start it first, simmer for about 10 minutes, and then add in the lentils to finish cooking for about 25 minutes.

3. **Make it with bulgur wheat**. This is another traditional way to make this recipe. Follow this mujadara recipe but with a few time changes. Cook the lentils for 20 minutes before adding the bulgur (instead of rice and no soaking required), and continue to cook for only 10 more minutes. Remove from the heat, and rest for 5 minutes with the lid on before adding the cumin and fluffing with a fork.

# Otra opción

## Ingredientes 

- 12 ounces broccoli florets- cut or broken into very small florets about equal size (about 6 cups packed)
- 8 ounces short pasta- orecchiette pasta, penne, rigatoni, etc
- 3 tablespoons olive oil
- 1 fat shallot, diced
- 6 garlic cloves- rough chopped
- generous pinch chili flakes ( Aleppo or Urfa biber is nice here)
- generous pinch salt and pepper, more to taste
- 1 teaspoon miso paste (or sub 1–2 mashed anchovies)
- 2 cups veggie broth or chicken broth
- 1–2 teaspoons lemon zest
- Garnish: grated parmesan or pecorino cheese,  lemon zest, truffle oil, fresh basil ribbons, toasted pine nuts, toasted bread crumbs, truffle oil or kalamata olives– all optional.

## Proceso

- Steam small broccoli florets until very tender (easily pierced with a fork)and set aside.
- Cook the pasta in 8 cups water with 1 tablespoon salt (measure),  Save a cup of hot pasta water when you drain.
In a large pan, saute the shallot and garlic and chili flakes in the olive oil, over medium heat until fragrant and golden, about 3 - minutes.  Stir in the miso paste (or anchovy), then add steamed broccoli,  salt, pepper and the broth.
Bring to a gentle simmer and start breaking apart the broccoli with a metal spatula into tiny pieces. As it cooks it will get easier to break apart. You want the broccoli to basically melt down into a “sauce”.  Continue simmering gently on low heat until half of the - liquid evaporates and it becomes the consistency of a thick sauce, about 10-15 minutes.
- If it seems watery and separated, just keep cooking it down. It won’t be smooth- but just broken down and very very tender.
- Add the pasta. Toss well. Add more hot pasta water to keep it ” saucy.” Add the lemon zest.
Taste for salt, adjust, adding more along with pepper, chili flakes. If you want more richness add another splash of olive oil (or pat - of butter- my husband loves this). Stir in some optional pecorino.
Divide among pasta bowls and top with any of the garnishes you like. Grated Parmesan or pecorino  adds depth,basil ribbons add flavor, - and a drizzle of truffle oil elevates.
- Enjoy!
