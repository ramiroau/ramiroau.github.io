# Ingredientes

- Chicken carcass, cooked
- 1.5 oz butter
- 1.5 oz EVOO
- ½ med sized onion, brunoised
- 3 oz all-purpose flour
- 4 cups of milk
- 2 tsp salt
- 2 dashes nutmeg
- 1 oz slice of Ibérico bellota, brunoise (could use ham or bacon too – optional)

# INstrucciones

- Pull meat form the cooked chicken carcass and chop finely.
- Put a pan onto the stove on medium heat
- Place onions in a pan with butter and oil.
- Sweat onions for 3 minutes
- Add chopped chicken
- Sauté and add flour to pan
- Mix well and cook for 2 minutes
- Remove pan from heat and add 1 cup of milk
- Use a whisk to work out the lumps.
- Continue to alternate adding milk and stirring mixture until all the milk is worked in.
- When all milk is added return pan to stove on low heat and add 2 tsp salt
- Season with a little black pepper and 2 dashes of nutmeg
- As it heats up, mixture will begin to thicken. You want the mixture to gently bubble
- Taste and add more salt if necessary
- Cook for 20 minutes whisking periodically to prevent burning. Be sure to stir all the way to the edges.
- Remove pan from heat, stir in the Ibérico or ham. 
- Pour all contents into a 9×13 pan
- Place a large piece of plastic wrap over the croqueta mix.  Press the plastic down so it makes contact with the mix to prevent a skin from forming on it.
- Place into fridge to chill completely. Overnight would be best.

# FRIED CROQUETAS

## Ingredients:

- Croqueta Base
- 1 qt of vegetable oil
- 2 cups of flour
- 2 eggs, whisked
- 2 cups of breadcrumbs

## Proceso

- Put 1 qt of oil into a pot and heat to 350F
- Use two spoons to form quenelles of the croqueta base (about 1 oz)
- Put the flour, eggs, and breadcrumbs into three different bowls.
- Place the quenelles into the flour bowl and coat evenly.
- Next, put them into the egg wash, followed by the breadcrumbs.
- Cover completely with breadcrumbs, shaking off excess crumbs.
- Carefully place the breaded croquetas into the oil, and fry until the crust becomes golden brown (3 minutes). Work in batches so that you don’t overfill the pot.
- Remove from oil using a slotted spoon and place onto a plate lined with paper towels to drain.
- Allow to cool for a minute before eating, as croquetas straight out of the fryer are extremely hot!
